Sean's review of Matt's wire frame:
The speech-to-text wire frame in Figma is an excellent example of how the feature will work under real conditions. It has been designed to guide the user through the steps for using speech-to-text so that the buttons can automatically be selected. The design includes multiple versions that can be switched, and with Figma's prototyping tool, the steps can be tested. There are also visual indicators of what the user should click during the presentation. The simple designs chosen would in turn simplify the coding process for the Hear-For-You group, as it provides a minimalistic approach to implementing their speech-to-text feature. 

Matt's review of Sean's code:
This code showcases an organized and flexible real-time object detection system using TensorFlow Lite for video processing. It efficiently loads a pre-trained model, records timestamps when bird detection confidence surpasses a set threshold, and incorporates visual cues like bounding boxes. The use of a configuration file enhances adaptability, and the code allows for user interruption via the 'q' key. With proper resource management, this implementation exemplifies clarity and efficiency in leveraging machine learning for dynamic video analysis.
